Official documentation:
https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/manage-data/add-data
This documentation covers all possible API calls.  These can be conducted with a number of languages, all of which are documented.  For querying, filters can be optionally used, but a general stream can also be used with no filters.  This could be useful if column names are not known.

After trying other video tutorials, this one appears to be the most optimal one.  It's condensed into a single 14 minute video. By being an official video from Firebase and a 2021 release, it's likely the most up to date tutorial.  It covers everything from initial app creation to how to use queries.
